Hello,
Welcome to my project " Basic Banking System ".

Overview :-
The Basic Banking System is a web-based application that allows users to transfer funds between accounts in a secure and efficient manner. It is designed to simulate basic banking operations, including viewing user details and transferring money between users. This project provides a simple interface for users to interact with the banking system and execute transfers effortlessly.

Features :-
1. User Management: View a list of users with email id, including balance.
2. Fund Transfer: Transfer funds between users securely.
3. Transaction History: Track past transactions with details such as sender, receiver, and transferred amount and date & time.
   
Technologies Used :-
1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript for responsive UI and interactive elements.

How It Works :-
1. User Selection: Select the user by entering email id to initiate a transfer.
2. Transfer Funds: specify the amount to transfer.
3. Transaction Confirmation: Once the transfer is successful, the new balances of both the sender and the recipient are updated.
4. View History: Users can view the transaction history to track the flow of funds.
